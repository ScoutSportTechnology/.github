# Scout Sport Technology

**Open-source sport cameras with AI-powered tracking.**

We’re building an open, affordable platform to capture sports—from grassroots fields to training centers.

## Vision
The goal is a community-driven **sports camera** that automates capture:
- **Accessible hardware**: Raspberry Pi / Jetson-based kits with swappable lenses.
- **AI tracking**: Real-time player/ball detection for auto pan/zoom/framing.
- **Open software**: Firmware and apps you can inspect, modify, and improve.
- **Extensible design**: Bring your own models and workflows.

## Projects in this org

- **ScoutCamera (`cam`)**
  - `sct-cam-firmware` — On-device software stack (video capture, AI inference, streaming).
  - `sct-cam-app` — Mobile companion app to control the camera, preview, and download footage.

- **Future projects**
  - `sct-studio-app` — Editing and post-production.
  - `sct-stats-app` — Performance analysis and stats tracking.

## Why open-source?
- Empower coaches, teams, and schools with accessible tools.
- Invite developers and makers to optimize AI, optics, and mechanics.
- Build a transparent stack that anyone can learn from and extend.

## Get involved
- Share feedback and feature ideas via issues.
- Improve docs, testing, and setup scripts.
- Contribute AI models, performance optimizations, or hardware designs.
- Help with UX for the mobile app.

## Roadmap
1. MVP firmware + app for live streaming and footage control.
2. Stable AI tracking (ball + players).
